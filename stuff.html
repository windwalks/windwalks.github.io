									I sit beside the fire and think
									<br>
									of all that I have seen,
									<br>
									of meadow-flowers and butterflies
									<br>
									in summers that have been;
									<br>
									<br>
									Of yellow leaves and gossamer
									<br>
									in autumns that there were,
									<br>
									with morning mist and silver sun
									<br>
									and wind upon my hair.
									<br>
									<br>
									I sit beside the fire and think
									<br>
									of how the world will be
									<br>
									when winter comes without a spring
									<br>
									that I shall never see.
									<br>
									<br>
									For still there are so many things
									<br>
									that I have never seen:
									<br>
									in every wood in every spring
									<br>
									there is a different green.
									<br>
									<br>
									I sit beside the fire and think
									<br>
									of people long ago,
									<br>
									and people who will see a world
									<br>
									that I shall never know.
									<br>
									<br>
									But all the while I sit and think
									<br>
									of times there were before,
									<br>
									I listen for returning feet
									<br>
									and voices at the door. 
									
									<hr>

									I must not fear.
									<br>
									Fear is the mind-killer.
									<br>
									Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
									<br>
									I will face my fear.
									<br>
									I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
									<br>
									And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
									<br>
									Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

									<hr>

									How very simple life would be
									<br>
									If only there were two of me
									<br>
									A Restless Me to drift and roam
									<br>
									A Quiet Me to stay at home.
									<br>
									A Searching One to find his fill
									<br>
									Of varied skies and newfound thrill
									<br>
									While sane and homely things are done
									<br>
									By the domestic Other One.
									<br>
									<br>
									And that's just where the trouble lies;
									<br>
									There is a Restless Me that cries
									<br>
									For chancy risks and changing scene,
									<br>
									For arctic blue and tropic green,
									<br>
									For deserts with their mystic spell,
									<br>
									For lusty fun and raising Hell,
									<br>
									<br>
									But shackled to that Restless Me
									<br>
									My Other Self rebelliously
									<br>
									Resists the frantic urge to move.
									<br>
									It seeks the old familiar groove
									<br>
									That habits make. It finds content
									<br>
									With hearth and home — dear prisonment,
									<br>
									With candlelight and well-loved books
									<br>
									And treasured loot in dusty nooks,
									<br>
									<br>
									With puttering and garden things
									<br>
									And dreaming while a cricket sings
									<br>
									And all the while the Restless One
									<br>
									Insists on more exciting fun,
									<br>
									It wants to go with every tide,
									<br>
									No matter where…just for the ride.
									<br>
									Like yowling cats the two selves brawl
									<br>
									Until I have no peace at all.
									<br>
									<br>
									One eye turns to the forward track,
									<br>
									The other eye looks sadly back.
									<br>
									I'm getting wall-eyed from the strain,
									<br>
									(It's tough to have an idle brain)
									<br>
									But One says "Stay" and One says "Go"
									<br>
									And One says "Yes," and One says "No,"
									<br>
									And One Self wants a home and wife
									<br>
									And One Self craves the drifter's life.
									<br>
									<br>
									The Restless Fellow mostly wins
									<br>
									I wish my folks had made me twins.
